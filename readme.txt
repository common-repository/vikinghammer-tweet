Send a tweet for any new post or comment to your blog.

== Description ==

This is the Vikinghammer Tweet plugin.

You can set it up to post tweets based on new posts or comments to your blog. This requires that you enter your Twitter credentials.

== Installation ==

1. Unpack the plugin in wp-content/plugins
1. Activate the plugin through the Plugins menu in Wordpress
1. Go to Settings > VH Tweet, and enter your blog's Twitter credentials (they can be your own credentials if you want, but I didn't want my blog posting tweets to my personal Twitter account, so I set up a separate one for each blog). After entering your credentials and clicking "Save," you're good to go.

You also have to decide whether you want to send tweets for comments, posts, or both. If you don't do that, nothing will happen.

Enjoy!
